## Introduction
  Hi, my name is Lev Gilady. I'm in 10th grade period 4. Im not the biggest fan of computer science but I find it pretty interesting. 
I'm about to turn 16 next month and I'm working on getting a drivers license. I have an appointment on september 29 for a learners permit test. Although I'll aleady be 16 by then. I'm really excited to drive myself places and not be stuck at home so much even though I have to wait until I'm 18 to drives my friends around I believe. 

I live with just my mom. my sister passed away about a year ago and my dad isn't in the picture anymore.
I plan to be a dentist when I'm older as of right now. It might change but all I know is that when I'm older I wanna help people. I want to be a dentist because I want to support my mom and my family so that they are well off. I want to work with kids do help them have good cleaning habits with their teeth because my mom always taught me those things. 

I want to be pretty financially comfortable when I'm older and I want to have a big house thats near the ocean. I plan to live in florida in pensicola when I can and maybe have my own dental practice their or I'll have to wait until I retire. I want to be weathy enough so I'm able to travel the world even though I'm aware that I'll probably have very little time off. I hope that with my own practic/buisness I start I'll be able to have a flexible schedule.
